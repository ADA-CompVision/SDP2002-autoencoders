DC GAN
This is an implementation of the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DC GAN)
algorithm for generating images using PyTorch. DC GAN is
a type of generative model that uses deep convolutional neural networks
to generate new images that are similar to a given dataset of real images.
Requirements
PyTorch: 
torchvision
numpy: 
matplotlib: 
Google Colab

Installation

git clone https://github.com/your_username/dc-gan.git

cd dc-gan

Upload the dataset:

Run the code:
Code Overview
Data loading: The code loads the dataset from
the specified path using PyTorch's ImageFolder dataset class. 
Generator and discriminator networks:
The code defines the generator and discriminator networks using PyTorch's nn.Module class. 
The generator takes a random input vector and generates a fake image,
while the discriminator takes an image and classifies it as real or fake.
Adam optimizer for updating the network weights.
Model evaluation: The code includes functions for evaluating the quality of the generated images.
Visualization: The code uses matplotlib to visualize the training progress
Results
The code generates images that are visually similar to the real images in the dataset.
The quality of the generated images depends on various factors such as the size of the dataset,
the architecture of the generator and discriminator networks, and the hyperparameters used during training.
