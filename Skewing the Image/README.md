Description:
This code provides examples of how to perform image transformation techniques on an input image
The transformations demonstrated include skewing, shifting, and scaling of an image.

Dependencies

OpenCV 
scikit-image 
numpy 

Installation

pip install numpy

Functions
The code will perform the following transformations on the input image:
Skewing: 
Shifting:
Scaling: 
Results
The transformed images will be saved as JPEG files in the same directory with the following filenames:
skewed.jpeg: the skewed image
shifted.jpg: the shifted image
scaled_image.jpeg: the scaled image
